# 🚀 GeekLab: My DevOps & IIoT Journey

Welcome to my **GeekLab** repository. This is a living documentation of my home lab environment, where I bridge the gap between **Industrial IoT** and **Cloud-Native DevOps**.

## 🎯 The Mission
I am an IIoT Full Stack developer transitioning into a **DevOps Engineer**. This repository serves as my "Infrastructure as Code" and technical manual for my Proxmox-based lab.

---

## 🏗️ The Infrastructure (Proxmox "GeekLab")

### ☁️ Virtualization & Orchestration
* **Proxmox VE (LXC & VMs):** The backbone of my lab.
* **Kubernetes Cluster:** Running containerized workloads and practicing orchestration.
* **Docker Instances:** Rapid deployment for microservices and IIoT gateways.

### 🛠️ Lab Components
* **Home Automation & IIoT:** Connecting physical sensors to high-level dashboards.
* **Homepage:** My central dashboard for service monitoring (Running on LXC).
